Yes, indeed, it is called Lothric

Where the traoilands of the Lords of Cinder converge

In venturing North

The Pilgrims oi the truth of the Old Words

The fire fades

And the Lords go without thoihen the link of Fire is threatened

The Bell tolls

Unearthing the old loicinder from their graves

Aldritch, Saint of the Deep,

Farron's Undead oithe Abyss Watchers,

And the reclusive lord of the profaned capital, Yhooiiant,

Only in truth, the Lords will abandon their thrones

And the Unkioill rise

Nameless accursed undead, unfit even to be cinder,

And so it ioish seeketh embers.
